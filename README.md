# JavaScript projects

This is a collection of simple projects that enable me to get a grasp on fundamentals of JavaScript.

Implementations, designs, and functionalities are referenced from online course on Youtube and Udemy.

I've read and wrote all lines of code by myself to established utmost understanding about Vanilla JS to its core.

It solidified my skill set on all aspect of JavaScipt; syntax, data sctruction, algorithms, debugging, ES6, asynchronoud functions, OOP, Funtional programming and overall front-end developemt concepts.

Some other concepts I have learned are communication with RESTful API, JSON/JSON server, local storage, Babel, Webpack, and Firebase 9.

Fundamentals are very important for developer to understand every aspect of the code.
It enabled me to quickly learn new concepts and JavaScript library/framework to recreate and implements more sophisticated functions and components with efiicient and maintainable code for future projects. (It already helped me in learing React.js! :D)
