# JavaScript projects

This is a collection of simple projects that enable me to get a grasp on fundamentals of JavaScript.

Implementations, designs, and functionalities are referenced from online course on Youtube and Udemy.

I've read and wrote all lines of code by myself to established utmost understanding about Vanilla JS to its core.

It solidified my skill set on all aspect of JavaScipt; syntax, data sctruction, algorithms, debugging, ES6, asynchronoud functions, OOP, Funtional programming and overall front-end developemt concepts.

Some other concepts I have learned are communication with RESTful API, JSON/JSON server, local storage, Babel, Webpack, and Firebase 9.

This provide a strong foundation in my web development skill and enabled me to quickly learn new concepts, library/framework, recreate and implements more sophisticated projects with efiicient and maintainable code. (It already helped me in learing React.js! :D)
